Q1.Write a blog on the difference between document and window object

INTRODUCTION:
 the Document and Window objects are fundamental entities that play crucial roles in creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
 These objects are part of the Document Object Model (DOM), a programming interface for HTML documents. While they may seem similar, 
 they serve distinct purposes and have different properties and methods. In this blog describe the differences between the Document and Window objects.

DOCUMENT OBJECT:
 The Document object represents the entire web page or document. It serves as a container for all the content displayed in the browser, including text, 
 images, forms, and more. Essentially, the Document object allows developers to access and manipulate the content and structure of a webpage.

Key Characteristics of the Document Object:

 i.Represents the Web Page Structure:
   The Document object acts as a hierarchical representation of the web page's structure, including elements like HTML, head, body, and their respective child elements.

 ii.Provides Access to Document Content:
    Developers can use the Document object to access and modify the content within the HTML document. This includes reading and updating text, attributes, styles, and event handling.

 iii.Methods for Document Manipulation:
    The Document object provides methods for creating, modifying, and removing elements and nodes in the document, allowing developers to dynamically change the webpage based on user 
    interactions or other events.

WINDOW OBLECT:
 The Window object represents the browser window that contains the document. It serves as a global object in the browser's JavaScript environment and provides 
 functionalities beyond the document-related operations.

Key Characteristics of the Window Object:
 i.Represents the Browser Window:
   The Window object encapsulates the entire browser window, including tabs, frames, and pop-ups. It provides access to the window's properties, methods, and events.

 ii.Global Object in the Browser Environment:
   The Window object is the global object in the browser, meaning it is the top-level object accessible from any JavaScript code running in the browser environment. 
   Global variables and functions are attached to this object.

 iii.Manages Window-Related Operations:
    The Window object enables operations related to the browser window, such as opening and closing new windows or tabs, navigating to URLs, setting timeouts, and handling events.
 
CONCLUTION:
 The Document object represents the structure and content of a web page, allowing developers to access and manipulate the document's elements and properties. 
 On the other hand, the Window object represents the browser window and provides functionalities for managing the window, opening new windows, handling events, and more.
